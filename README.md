# LuccaTube ðŸ“½

**LuccaTube** is an open-source [SyncTube](https://sync-tube.de/) clone, powered by Node.js and the [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) Websockets framework.

This project is still in its very early stages and is currently in development. This was made exclusively for educational purposes.
